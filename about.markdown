As a seasoned software developer, I have always been drawn to new challenges and opportunities to grow. This is what motivated me to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in machine learning. My passion for this field has led me to work on exciting projects in robotics and digital pathology, and I am now a Research Associate at TU-Berlin embarking on my PhD journey. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries and excited to see where it will take me next.
