Have you ever wanted to share your cool Python app with the world without deploying an entire Django server or developing a mobile app just for a small project?

Easy, right? This is made possible by [WebAssembly][WebAssembly] (Wasm) and the [Pyodide][Pyodide] project.
So what can we actually do? Spoiler: With the power of Python and JS, we can do almost anything. But before getting into the details, let me first tell you a little story behind this writing.
